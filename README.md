# Coverage Path Planning

This project has for goal to create, test and compare different CPP algorithms. 

## Algorithms

2 algorithms are currently implemented

  - ### Glouton
    At each step, the algorithm goes to the last discovered but not visited case.
    
  - ### Shortest Path
    At each step, the algorithm goes to the closest case discovered but not visited.

## Source code

The project is divided in 3 main packages :

  - ### creation
    Files for creating the algorithm test environment

  - ### sovlings
    The different solving algorithms currently implemented

  - ### gui
    Files for the graphical interface
